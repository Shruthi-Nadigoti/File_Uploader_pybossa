       n_task_runs, overall_progress, last_activity,
       n_results) = project_by_shortname(short_name)
       title = project_title(project, "Delete")
       ensure_authorized_to('read', project)
       ensure_authorized_to('delete', project)
       pro = pro_features()
       project_sanitized, owner_sanitized = sanitize_project_owner(project, owner, current_user)
       if request.method == 'GET':
           response = dict(template='/projects/delete.html',
                           title=title,
                           project=project_sanitized,
                           owner=owner_sanitized,
                           n_tasks=n_tasks,
                           overall_progress=overall_progress,
                           last_activity=last_activity,
                           pro_features=pro,
                           csrf=generate_csrf())
           return handle_content_type(response)
       if("directory_names" in project.info.keys()):
           for i in project.info["directory_names"]:
               if os.path.exists(i):
                   shutil.rmtree(i)#deleting the actual folder
       project_repo.delete(project)
       auditlogger.add_log_entry(project, None, current_user)
       flash(gettext('Project deleted!'), 'success')
       return redirect_content_type(url_for('account.profile', name=current_user.name))
